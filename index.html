                <h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>

                <h3>WHAT ARE WE DOING?</h3>
                <p>The aim of the project is to deliver a quality Security handbook to you, KidzGamez' employees. The handbook exists in the form of a website and involves the most relevant topics on web Security. Understandable and easy-to-read articles should make each KidzGamez's intranet user aware of the Internet Security basics and existing threats. No doubt, the main idea is to enlighten, not to frighten!</p>

                <h3>HOW ARE WE DOING THAT?</h3>
                <p>Everything you see right now is done with the help of text editors, HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h3>WHAT FOR?</h3>
                <p>On the rebound of numerous massive data leaks, KidzGames has decided to approach the students of the Secure Website Project course due to the fact the firm is not able to foresee the Security patterns and risks that the new purchase system brings. Besides, the company seeks to familiarize the employees with basics and "trends" of online Security.</p>
