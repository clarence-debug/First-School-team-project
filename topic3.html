        <section id="team1">
            <p>As for the notion, malware refers to a malicious software &#40;e.g.,trojan, virus, spyware&#41; installed on a computer or mobile device. This software compromises the integrity of a device by giving attackers the possibility to access personal information, monitor and control one's online activities.</p>
            <br>
        <p>The following tips can help improve your vigilance in relation to social engineering hacks and malwares.</p>
        <ol>	
		   <dt><b>Don’t open emails and attachments from suspicious sources</b> – If you don’t know the sender in question, you don’t need to answer the email.
		          Even if you do know him/her and are suspicious about their message, cross-check and confirm the news from other sources, such as via telephone
				  or directly from a service provider’s site. Remember that email addresses are spoofed all of the time; even an email purportedly coming from
				  a trusted source may have actually been initiated by an attacker.</dt><br>
            <dt><b>Use multifactor authentication</b> – One of the most valuable pieces of information that attackers seek are user credentials. 
			      Using multifactor authentication helps to ensure one's account’s protection in the event of system compromise.</dt><br>
            <dt><b>Be wary of tempting offers</b>– If an offer sounds too enticing, think twice before accepting it as a fact. 
			      Googling the topic can help you quickly determine whether you’re dealing with a legitimate offer or a trap.</dt><br>
            <dt><b>Keep your antivirus/antimalware software updated</b> – Make sure automatic updates are allowed, or make it a habit to download
			      the latest signatures first thing each day. Periodically check to make sure that the updates have been applied, and scan your system for possible infections.</dt><br>
            <dt><b>Get an ad-blocker.</b> Malvertising – where hackers use infected banners or pop-up ads to infect your device – is on the rise.
        			You can’t know which ads are bad: so it’s safer to just block them all with a reliable ad-blocker.</dt><br>
        </ol>
		<p><strong>NB:</strong> There is no perfect method to prevent data theft and attacks. Getting yourself educated on the topic and the use of common sense
             		is important in addition to the above recommendations.</p>
